  <p class="paragraph">
    <strong>Role:</strong> Solo Product Designer & Art Director.<br>
    <strong>Time:</strong> Late 2018- Early 2019.<br>
    I was addressed by Access Israel to design solution for small and medium business owners in Israel, who need to make sure their locations comply with the Israeli accessibility regulations.
    The work was conducted in collaboration with the organization's developers team.

  <h2 class="heading_02 slide__heading ">The Value:</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
<strong>From Access Israel POV: </strong>
<ul class="paragraph paragraph__ul">
<li>Scaling the annual rate of accessibility compliance among small and medium businesses in Israel.</li>

<li>Removing work-load from organization consultancy department.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<strong>From Business owner POV: </strong>

    <h2 class="heading_02 slide__heading ">The state of Accessibility in Israel:</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
<ul class="paragraph paragraph__ul">
<li>Every 5th person in Israel is considered disabled or with special needs.</li>
<li>Israeli regulation require services to be accessible, and failure to do so may result in loss of business license.</li>
<li>Accessibility is a "hot topic" in the social arena, including shaming for inaccessible businesses, discriminating clients with disabilities.</li>
<li>Accessibility compliance modifications might involve expensive spatial and structural modifications, as well as special equipment.</li>

<section class="slide__content">
<h2 class="heading_02 slide__heading ">Small-business owners in Israel:</h2>
<h3 class="heading_03 slide__heading ">Basic input:</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
Based on set of interviews, including small to medium businesses that serve clients on-site: Hairdressers and Barber-shops,  bars, small restaurants and private clinics, mostly in central urban areas (Tel-Aviv, Jerusalem).
<ul class="paragraph paragraph__ul">
<li>Operate in constant "Survival mode": highly taxed, heavily regulated, often reliant on frequently changing personnel and external suppliers.</li>
<li>Many businesses operate from rented rather venues rather than owned ones.</li>
<li>Most businesses Plan for approximately two years ahead max.</li>
<li>Have Limited understanding of accessibility as a field and view it as a "black box" (repeating quote from 2 interviews). Intimidated by the cost & complexity of the accessibility process.</li>
<li>Rely heavily on social networks for advertising and fear shaming.</li>
<li>Recognize the importance of subject, identify with the need, as well as seeing a potential in expanding their clientele.</li>
<li>Interested in being on "good side" of society.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<h3 class="heading_03 slide__heading ">Current user journey:</h3>
<p class="paragraph">The journey at point of departure is mostly an intimidating experience, getting clearer as the business owner become more envolved. 
    It begins with ordering (and paying for) an accessibility consultant, who surveys the place, negotiate professionals to conduct the modifications (consultants often connect businesses with their own people).</p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    <ul class="paragraph paragraph__ul">
    <li><strong>Reduces costs</strong> of an overall expensive procedure.</li>

    <ul class="paragraph paragraph__ul">
    <li><strong>Short term:</strong> Reduce overhead pressure on the organization by disintermediating the human consultants from first process phases.</li>
    <li><strong>Long term 1:</strong> Encourage businesses compliance with accessibility regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Long term 2:</strong> Building accessibility-awareness and understanding within the business community (Conversion of business owners to ambassadors).</li>

<h2 class="heading_02 slide__heading ">Optional solutions considered:</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
    <ul class="paragraph paragraph__ul">
        <li><strong>a Simple Google Form</strong> was considered as most basic solution in terms of costs and schedule. Problematic aspects were possible high friction due to the long list of inputs, and lack of users trust to enter private business data into a platform that might look sketchy.</li>
        <li><strong>Online branded experience</strong> was the middle-weight (and eventually selected) solution, that will guide business owners through manually filling the form, and streamline the experience to reduce friction as much as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Native mobile app</strong> was brought-up as high-end option, that will include sensor-supported measuring through the app, to increase accuracy of the input.</li>

<h2 class="heading_02 slide__heading ">Design Principles:</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
<ul class="paragraph paragraph__ul">
<li><h5 class="heading_05">Reduce friction as much as possible:</h5> Short questions. Clear inputs. Many small content pieces over few massive ones. Auto-save frequently.</li>
<li><h5 class="heading_05">Educate:</h5> Include rule and reasoning available for every question.</li>
<li><h5 class="heading_05">Mobile first:</h5> Consider users will be walking around the location measuring and checking things.</li>
<li><h5 class="heading_05">Gamified, yet accessible:</h5></li> The entire flow retained AA compliance, yet provided constant rewarding feedbacks in educating, yet playfull tones.

<section class="slide__content">
    <h2 class="heading_02 slide__heading ">Main experience challenge:</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
       <strong> Friction:</strong> It is a Very long survey. We were looking for ways to streamline user-flow through all phases, in the most seamless way possible.<br><br>

<section class="slide__content">
<h2 class="heading_02 slide__heading ">Design Goal:</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
   <strong>Business Owner will be able to complete full survey,<br> by using any single input source (Mouse/ Keyboard navigation/ Touch), <br>without typing.</strong>
</p>
</section>
<section class="slide__content">
<h2 class="heading_02 slide__heading">Basic Information Architecture:</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The entire accessibility survey- dozens of questions originally filled into a Microsoft Word document or plain paper- was categorized by physical domains of business location (parking, entrance, elevators, office, toilet, etc.), each forms a chapter in the survey, and validated by several user-tests as a mental model.
